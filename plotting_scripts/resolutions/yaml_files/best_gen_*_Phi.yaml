#//Configuration file for Auto Plotting class. Lines starting with "//" are to be dismissed.
#//This file is supposed to be kept in one of the following paths and is given in the priority order:
#//1. Directory of the main program
#//2. config/ directory
#//
#//X and Y for 3D plots (2D histograms), for 2D plots XZ plane is used NOT XY
#//
#//IMPORTANT NOTES!
#//Blanks lead to automatic settings. Automatic means either preset or automatic adjustment (which is on the way).
#//Originally "\Default Settings" were set to match default or "zero" values at preinitialization and are
#//treated as "empty" values. IF AND ONLY IF "\Main Settings" match the "zero" values, they become vulnerable and CAN
#//BE overriden by Default Settings. In case that happens and user does not remember original Default Settings,
#//"\Manual Override" section can be used to fix the issue OR use void Change_variable(string, string) in the code,
#//which is less recommended.
